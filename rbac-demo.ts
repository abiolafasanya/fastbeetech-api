/**
 * RBAC System Test & Demo Script
 *
 * This script demonstrates the new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system
 *
 * To run this script:
 * 1. Make sure MongoDB is running with the seeded roles
 * 2. Start the server: npm run dev
 * 3. Create a test user and assign roles using the API
 * 4. Test the endpoints below

🚀 RBAC System Demo - Test Commands

1. Get User Permissions:
   GET ${API_BASE}/me/permissions
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <your-jwt-token>" }

2. Check Specific Permission:
   POST ${API_BASE}/me/permissions/check
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <your-jwt-token>" }
   Body: { "permission": "course:create" }

3. Check Multiple Permissions:
   POST ${API_BASE}/me/permissions/check-any
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <your-jwt-token>" }
   Body: { "permissions": ["course:create", "course:edit", "blog:publish"] }

4. Create Course (with permission check):
   POST ${API_BASE}/courses
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <your-jwt-token>" }
   Body: { "title": "Test Course", "description": "Test", "slug": "test-course" }

5. Test Permission Denied:
   Try accessing admin-only endpoints with a student role

📋 Roles Available (seeded):
- super-admin: Full system access
- admin: Manage users, courses, blog posts  
- author: Create/edit courses and blog posts
- student: View courses, enroll, view blog posts

🔐 Permission Examples:
- course:create, course:edit, course:delete, course:publish
- blog:create, blog:edit, blog:delete, blog:publish  
- user:view, user:edit, user:delete, user:manage_roles
- system:admin

🛠️ Next Steps:
1. Create users with different roles
2. Test API endpoints with different permission levels
3. Implement frontend role-based menu rendering
4. Add admin interface for role management
